# SENG 300 Project 

## Prerequsites
1) The app does not yet have a remote database. To run properly a local mysql database must exist. The schema must be named 'scholarship', and contain a table called 'users' with a username and password column. The front-end should run without this prerequisite.

2) from the client directory run `npm install`
3) from the server directory run  `npm install`

## Running
1) from the root directory run  `npm run dev`
